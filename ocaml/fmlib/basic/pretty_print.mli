(** Pretty Printer: Generate nicely formatted ascii text. *)

(** {1 Overview} *)

(** {2 Example}

    The usage of the pretty printer is best explained by an example. Suppose
    we want to print the function application [f a b (g c d) e] where the
    function names and arguments might have different length. We create a {i
    document} which represents the structure by

    {[
    let doc =
        group (
            text "f" <+> space <+>
            indent
                2
                (stack_or_pack
                    " "
                    [text "a";
                     text "b";
                     group (
                         text "(g" <+> space <+>
                         indent
                            2
                            (stack_or_pack " " [text "c"; text "d"])
                         <+> text ")");
                     text "e"])
        )
    ]}

    where [text "blabla"] is a document with some unbreakable text, [<+>]
    concatenates two documents, [space] is a break hint whose alternative text
    is a blank, [stack_or_pack atxt [...]] stacks a list of documents separated
    by a break hint with the alternative text [atxt].

    The command

    {[let stream = layout 5 doc ]}

    creates a stream of characters which is nicely formatted using a desired
    line width of 5 characters. Since 5 characters are not enough to put any of
    the subterms completely on a line, the output is

    {[
    123456789012345
    f
      a
      b
      (g
        c
        d)
      d
    ]}

    i.e. each break hint is printed as a newline.

    If we give the pretty printer a line width of 10, it could pack the
    application [g c d] on a line and print

    {[
    123456789012345
    f
      a
      b
      (g c d)
      d
    ]}

    If the pretty printer has enough line width e.g. a line width of 15, it can
    put the whole expression on a line.

    {[
    123456789012345
    f a b (g c d) d
    ]}

    By using [stack_or_pack] we instructed the pretty printer to either print
    all break hints as newlines or all break hints with their alternative texts.
    If we use [pack] instead of [stack_or_pack], the pretty printer tries to
    pack as many arguments as possible on a line.

    E.g. with a line width of 11 and using [pack] instead of [stack_or_pack] we
    get the output

    {[
    123456789012345
    f
      a b
      (g c d) d
    ]}

    With a line width of 10 and using [pack] we get

    {[
    123456789012345
    f
      a b
      (g c d)
      d
    ]}

    because the pretty printer cannot pack [(g c d)] and [d] on a single line.

(** {2 Character Stream}

    The basic type [t] of the pretty printer is a lazy character stream. I.e.
    characters are only generated if needed. The pretty printer implements the
    interface {!Module_types.READABLE} to represent a character stream. You can
    ask the stream [has_more r] whether there are more characters in the stream
    and [peek r] to get the next character. The instruction [advance r] returns
    the stream [r] advanced by one character position.

    The pretty printer has a function [string_of r] to return a string
    representation of the character stream.

    However you very rarely need a string representation of a character stream.
    All io function in {!Fmlib} are able to handle character streams.

(** {1 Generate Documents}

    Clearly, it is tedious to write documents by hand. Usually you have some
    tree like structure and you want to generate a document from the tree
    structure.

    Let's assume you have a tree structure like

    {[
    type tree =
        { name: string; children: tree list; }

    let leaf (name: string): tree =
        {name; children = [] }

    let tree (name: string) (children: tree list): tree =
        {name; children}
    ]}

    Write a function which converts the tree structure to a document.

    {[
    let doc_of_tree (tree: tree): doc =
        let rec doc is_top tree =
            match tree.children with
            | [] ->
                text tree.name
            | _ ->
                let d =
                    parent_child
                        " " 2
                        (text tree.name)
                        (children tree.children ())
                in
                if is_top then
                    d
                else
                    char '(' <+> d <+> char ')'
        and children lst () =
            match lst with
            | [last] ->
                doc false last
            | head :: tail ->
                doc false head <+> space
                >> children tail    (* Lazy concatenation!! *)
            | [] ->
                assert false (* 'lst' is never empty *)
        in
        doc true tree
    ]}

    Then the simple command

    {[
    tree
        "f"
        [leaf "a";
         leaf "b";
         tree "g" [leaf "c"; leaf "d"];
         leaf "e"]
    |> layout 10
    ]}

    generates the character stream

    {[
    123456789012345
    f
      a
      b
      (g c d)
      e
    ]}


    Note the usage of the lazy concatentation operator [>>] in the recursive
    part of the function handling the children. This makes sure that even if the
    tree structure is hugh, the iteration over it is done only on demand. I.e.
    recursive calls are made only if the corresponding characters are needed
    when processing the character stream.

(** [layout width ribbon doc] Layout the document [doc] with a the line [width]
    and the [ribbon] width. Note: [width] is the complete line width and
    [ribbon] is the line width minus the indentation of the current line. *)

(** An empty document. *)
val empty: doc


(** [text str] A document with the unbreakable string [str]. *)
val text: string -> doc


(** [substring str start length] A document with the unbreakable string [str]
    starting at position [start] and having [length]. *)
val substring: string -> int -> int -> doc


(** [char c] A document with the character [c]. *)
val char: char -> doc


(** [fill n c] A document with [n] repetitions of the character [c]. *)

(** [break str] A break hint with the alternative text [str]. *)
val break: string -> doc


(** [space] A break hint with a blank as alternative text. *)
val space: doc


(** [cut] A break hint with an empty alternative text. *)
val cut: doc


(** [group doc]

    Treat all break hints belonging directly to [doc] consistently.
    Either print all as newlines or print all with their alternative text.

    This is the basic operation to decide break hints.

    If the whole group and all text which follows until the next break hint
    after the group fits on a line, then all break hints (directly or
    indirectly) in the group are flattened i.e. printed with their alternative
    texts.

    If the whole group does not fit, then all break hints belonging directly to
    the group are printed as effective newlines. The break hints of inner groups
    are considered separately.
*)
val group: doc -> doc


(** [nest n doc]

    The document [doc] indented by [n] blanks.

    This is the basic function to indicate a substructure to the pretty printer.
    The substructure is indented with respect to the parent document.

    The indentation is valid after each effective line break. It is usually
    convenient to group the whole substructure and put a break hint before the
    group and group the parent structure and the substructure. This makes sure
    that either the parent and the child fit on a line or the child begins on a
    newline and is indented. See the function [parent_child] below which does
    exactly that.
*)
val nest: int -> doc -> doc



(** [parent_child hint indent parent child]

    Put the parent and the child in a group and separate them by a break hint
    with the alternative text [hint]. Furthermore put the child in a separate
    group.

    Equivalent to
    {[
    parent
    <+> break hint
    <+> nest indent (group child)
    |> group
    ]}
*)
val parent_child: string -> int -> doc -> doc -> doc



(** [with_width n doc] Format the document [doc] with line [width].*)

(** [doc >> lazy_doc] Concatenate the document [doc] with the lazy document
    [lazy_doc]. *)

(** [cat list] Concatenate all documents in the [list] of documents. *)
val cat: doc list -> doc

(** [pack str list] Pack as much documents of the [list] of documents as possible
    into a line. I.e. separate all documents by a break hint with [str] as an
    alternative text. *)
val pack: string -> doc list -> doc


(** [stack str list] The same as [separated_by (break str) list]. *)
val stack: string -> doc list -> doc

(** [stack_or_pack str list]
    Separate all documents of the [list] by a break hint with alternative text
    [str] and either print all break hints as newlines of with the alternative
    text [str]. *)
val stack_or_pack: string -> doc list -> doc

(** [wrap_words str]
